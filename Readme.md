# Flipkart Web Scraping with Scrapy

## Overview

This Python project allows you to scrape product information from Flipkart based on your search query and the number of pages you want to scrape. It utilizes the Scrapy framework for efficient and structured web scraping.

## Features

- **Scraping Flipkart**: The script scrapes product details (e.g., name, price, rating) from Flipkart based on your search query.
- **Customizable Page Limit**: You can specify the number of pages to scrape for more extensive results.
- **Structured Data**: The scraped data is organized into structured output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Scrapy framework (install via `pip`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flipkart-scrapy.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd flipkart
```

## Usage

1. Modify the Scrapy spider, located in `flipkart/spiders/flipkart_spider.py`, to include your search query and any additional details you want to scrape.

2. In the project's root directory, run the Scrapy spider with the following command:

```bash
scrapy crawl flipkart -a search_query="your_query" -a pages_to_scrape=5 -o output.json
```

- Replace `your_query` with the search query you want to use.
- Adjust `pages_to_scrape` to specify the number of pages to scrape.
- The scraped data will be saved in the specified output file (`output.json` in this example).

## Customization

You can customize the spider by modifying the spider script to extract specific information or add more scraping functionalities.
